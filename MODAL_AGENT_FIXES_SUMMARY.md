# Modal Agent Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

Based on the logs analysis, the Modal agent was experiencing the following problems:

1. **Connection Failures**: Workers were spawning but immediately failing to establish connections to LiveKit
2. **Job Context Issues**: The error "The job task completed without establishing a connection" indicated `ctx.connect()` was failing
3. **No Retry Logic**: Single connection attempts were failing without retry mechanisms
4. **Poor Error Handling**: Limited debugging information when connections failed

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Connection Retry Logic (`livekit_entrypoint`)

**Before**: Single connection attempt with no retry
```python
await ctx.connect()
```

**After**: Retry logic with up to 5 attempts
```python
max_connect_attempts = 5
connect_attempt = 0
connected = False

while connect_attempt < max_connect_attempts and not connected:
    try:
        connect_attempt += 1
        print(f"[Modal Agent] Connection attempt {connect_attempt}/{max_connect_attempts}")
        
        await ctx.connect()
        connected = True
        print(f"[Modal Agent] Job context connected successfully on attempt {connect_attempt}")
        
    except Exception as connect_error:
        print(f"[Modal Agent] Connection attempt {connect_attempt} failed: {str(connect_error)}")
        if connect_attempt < max_connect_attempts:
            print(f"[Modal Agent] Waiting 3 seconds before retry...")
            await asyncio.sleep(3)
        else:
            print(f"[Modal Agent] Max connection attempts reached, failing")
            raise connect_error
```

### 2. Session Start Retry Logic

**Before**: Single session start attempt
```python
await session.start(room=ctx.room, agent=agent, ...)
```

**After**: Retry logic with up to 3 attempts
```python
max_session_attempts = 3
session_attempt = 0
session_started = False

while session_attempt < max_session_attempts and not session_started:
    try:
        session_attempt += 1
        print(f"[Modal Agent] Session start attempt {session_attempt}/{max_session_attempts}")
        
        await session.start(room=ctx.room, agent=agent, ...)
        
        session_started = True
        print(f"[Modal Agent] Session started successfully on attempt {session_attempt}")
        
    except Exception as session_error:
        print(f"[Modal Agent] Session start attempt {session_attempt} failed: {str(session_error)}")
        if session_attempt < max_session_attempts:
            print(f"[Modal Agent] Waiting 2 seconds before retry...")
            await asyncio.sleep(2)
        else:
            print(f"[Modal Agent] Max session start attempts reached, failing")
            raise session_error
```

### 3. Improved Worker Function (`run_agent_worker`)

**Before**: Basic worker creation and error handling
```python
worker = Worker(WorkerOptions(...))
await worker.run()
```

**After**: Enhanced worker lifecycle management
```python
worker = None

while retry_count < max_retries:
    try:
        print(f"[Modal Worker] Creating worker for room: {room_name} (attempt {retry_count + 1})")
        
        worker = Worker(WorkerOptions(...))
        print(f"[Modal Worker] Worker created successfully, starting for room: {room_name}")
        
        await worker.run()
        break
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Enhanced error handling and retry logic
        retry_count += 1
        print(f"[Modal Worker] Error in worker for room {room_name} (attempt {retry_count}): {str(e)}")
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()
        
        if retry_count >= max_retries:
            raise
        else:
            await asyncio.sleep(5)
    finally:
        # Proper cleanup
        if worker:
            await worker.drain()
            await worker.aclose()
```

### 4. New Test Endpoints

Added `test_livekit_connection` endpoint to test basic LiveKit connectivity without full agent setup:

```python
@app.function(image=image)
@fastapi_endpoint(method="POST")
async def test_livekit_connection(request: dict):
    """Test endpoint to verify LiveKit connection without full agent setup"""
    # Tests basic LiveKit worker creation and connection
    # Helps isolate connection issues from agent setup issues
```

### 5. Enhanced Logging and Debugging

- Added detailed connection attempt logging
- Added session start attempt logging
- Added worker creation and cleanup logging
- Added traceback information for all errors

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Successful Connection Flow
1. **Worker spawns** → `[Modal Worker] Running worker for room: {room_name}`
2. **Worker creates** → `[Modal Worker] Worker created successfully, starting for room: {room_name}`
3. **Connection attempts** → `[Modal Agent] Connection attempt 1/5`
4. **Connection success** → `[Modal Agent] Job context connected successfully on attempt 1`
5. **Session start attempts** → `[Modal Agent] Session start attempt 1/3`
6. **Session success** → `[Modal Agent] Session started successfully on attempt 1`
7. **Agent ready** → `[Modal Agent] Clara AI agent session started successfully`

### Error Handling
- Connection failures now retry up to 5 times with 3-second delays
- Session start failures now retry up to 3 times with 2-second delays
- Detailed error logging with tracebacks for debugging
- Proper cleanup of resources even when errors occur

## Testing Steps

### 1. Deploy Updated Code
```bash
cd backend
modal deploy modal_app.py
```

### 2. Run Test Script
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r test_requirements.txt
python test_modal_deployment.py
```

### 3. Test LiveKit Connection
```bash
curl -X POST https://d3n-ops--clara-voice-agent-test-livekit-connection.modal.run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

### 4. Test Voice Session
1. Start frontend: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/chat/study`
3. Click "Start Voice Session"
4. Monitor Modal logs for connection messages

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Check Modal Logs
```bash
# Check app logs
modal app logs d3n-ops--clara-voice-agent

# Check function logs
modal function logs d3n-ops--clara-voice-agent-run-agent-worker
```

### Expected Log Messages
- Connection attempt messages with retry counts
- Session start attempt messages with retry counts
- Detailed error messages with tracebacks
- Successful connection and session start confirmations

### Troubleshooting
- If connection test fails: Check LiveKit credentials and URL
- If worker spawns but doesn't connect: Check connection retry logs
- If session start fails: Check session retry logs and agent initialization
- If all tests pass but voice session fails: Check frontend connection and webhook delivery

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the updated code** to Modal
2. **Run the test script** to verify all endpoints are working
3. **Test the LiveKit connection** endpoint specifically
4. **Start a voice session** from the frontend
5. **Monitor Modal logs** for the new detailed connection messages
6. **Verify the agent joins** the LiveKit room successfully

The fixes should resolve the "job task completed without establishing a connection" errors by providing robust retry logic and better error handling for both the connection and session establishment phases.
