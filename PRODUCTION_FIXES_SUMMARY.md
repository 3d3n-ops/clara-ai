   - Environment variables checklist

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions (User Required)

1. **Add PostHog Environment Variable**:
   - Go to Vercel dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=your_posthog_project_api_key`
   - Redeploy the application

2. **Verify Backend Environment Variables**:
   - Check Render backend for these variables:
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
     - `PINECONE_API_KEY`
     - `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`
     - `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`

3. **Test File Upload with Enhanced Logging**:
   - Try uploading the same PDF file again
   - Check browser console for detailed frontend logs
   - Check backend logs for detailed error information

### Testing Steps

1. **Test PostHog Fix**:
   - After adding the environment variable, check browser console
   - Should no longer see "PostHog was initialized without a token"
   - Events should start appearing in PostHog dashboard

2. **Test Folder Creation**:
   - Try creating a folder in the application
   - Check browser console for detailed error messages
   - Check backend logs in Render dashboard

3. **Test File Upload**:
   - Try uploading the same PDF file again
   - Check for detailed logging in browser console and backend logs
   - Try uploading different file types to isolate the issue

4. **Test API Directly**:
   ```bash
   # Test folder creation
   curl -X POST https://clara-ai-kq0a.onrender.com/homework/folders \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Test Folder", "description": "Test", "user_id": "test_user"}'

   # Test file upload
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/homework/upload-rag \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "filename": "test.txt",
       "content": "Test content",
       "user_id": "test_user",
       "folder_id": null
     }'
   ```

## Monitoring and Verification

### PostHog Monitoring
- Check PostHog dashboard for events after fix
- Verify user identification is working
- Check for any remaining initialization errors

### Backend Monitoring
- Monitor Render logs for detailed error messages
- Check for Pinecone connection issues
- Monitor API response times
- Check for file upload processing errors

### User Experience Monitoring
- Test folder creation functionality
- Test file upload functionality
- Monitor for any remaining 500 errors
- Check for improved error messages

## Files Modified

1. `components/PostHogProvider.tsx` - Added error handling
2. `lib/analytics.ts` - Improved error handling and logging
3. `app/api/homework/folders/route.ts` - Enhanced error handling and logging
4. `app/api/homework/upload/route.ts` - Enhanced upload error handling and logging
5. `backend/backend_server.py` - Added detailed logging and validation
6. `backend/rag_engine.py` - Added step-by-step logging
7. `PRODUCTION_ENV.md` - Added PostHog configuration
8. `PRODUCTION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Created comprehensive guide
9. `FILE_UPLOAD_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Created file upload specific guide

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing these fixes:

1. **PostHog Error**: Should be resolved once environment variable is added
2. **500 Error**: Should provide more detailed error messages to help identify root cause
3. **File Upload Error**: Should provide detailed logging to identify exact failure point
4. **Debugging**: Much easier to identify issues with enhanced logging
5. **User Experience**: Better error messages and graceful degradation

## Fallback Behavior

- If PostHog is not configured, analytics will be disabled but the app will continue to work
- If backend is unavailable, users will get specific error messages instead of generic 500 errors
- If file upload fails, users will get detailed error messages about what went wrong
- All errors are now logged with detailed information for debugging
